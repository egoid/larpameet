larpa meet - a tindr for star war fans to find role playing partners
=====================

Readme:
Because I'm developing for an Android phone off of a mac, and using Facebook oAuth, I have to use the Facebook SDK method for testing in browser and the Cordova oAuth method to test on mobile. At the moment the code for the mobile testing is enabled and the code for the facebook SDK for browser testing is commented out.

To - Do list:
-Matching Algorithm by proximity
-Chatroom view
-Switch the Facebook SDK's library for http requests to the Facebook Graph API
-Emitting match events from the backend

Completed:
-User Auth via Facebook
-Back End User profile persistence
-Tindr Swipe animations
-UI \ UX directions
